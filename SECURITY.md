# Security Policy

As we are just starting out, there is not much of a policy, the Security is **AS IS, NOT GUARANTEED, AND HAS NO WARRANTY** if you do decide to clone or fork this repository for yourself and own use.


## Vulnerability reporting

To report a security vulnerability , please use the security tab and report it there for the maintainers who will then review it and possibly make an issue for it if deemed low enough.

A security support table will be made soon once progress is made.
