# Security Policy

As we are just starting out, there is not much of a policy, the Security is **AS IS, NOT GUARANTEED, AND HAS NO WARRANTY** if you do decide to clone or fork this repository for yourself and own use.

To report a security vulnerability , please make an issue and tag it as a **SECURITY ALERT** in the issue section, choosing the appropriate security level from *Low, Medium, and High.*

A security support table will be made soon once progress is made.
