# Welcome to the  *File System* Repository!

This is a simple project I want to revive in order to test what I have learned now by the grace of The Great Lord Above along with keeping some the technology I also discovered when I was building it. I ask that if new features want to be made by a member of the public, please make an "Issue" and assign yourself to it, or, fork this repo and ask for a commit be reviewed. As I go along, I will make issues on things I am not too sure about. I do ask that we also use the "Discussion" feature and if you want to join the discord server, you may. Thank you and I hope you also enjoy this adventure!

### Specifications:

The website uses a mix of HTML 5, Javascript, PHP 8, and CSS. It was running on an ubuntu server and will use MySQL. An attempt to reform to PDO for security will be made.

Security is **AS IS, NOT GUARANTEED, AND HAS NO WARRANTY.**
